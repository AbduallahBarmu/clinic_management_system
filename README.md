## Abstract
The Clinic Management System is built to support and simplify the clinic everyday service. Clinic
Management System is a system that can allow the clinic to control their everyday operation. This
system covers all clinic activities which includes doctor records, patients records, and the clinic
pharmacy records.
This application enables clinic managers to handle patient reports, inventory of medication, and clinic
doctors information which are stored in text files. The application is user-friendly, quick and convenient
for the user to use. Overall, this system supports the regular operation of a clinic, such as viewing,
inserting, updating and deleting records.
To protect the privacy of the patients, doctors and the clinic information safe we secured the system
with an encrypted password that is stored in a separate file.

##Used Technologies 
Core: C/C++ , Files for storing data  


##Introduction
Clinics have a lot of doctors, daily patients and active pharmacies. Each of these entities must be
managed carefully and flawlessly. With a traditional file system these entities are hard to manage for
clinic employees. 

#Project Design
##Interface
Since this program has been built using c++ programming, the interface is using console application and in the paragraph, we are going to demonstrate the function of the main pages that appears in the program, and the detailed process is to be demonstrated in the user manual part in upcoming sections.

First page to be shown is the login page, which allow you to create a password for the first use or use your old password for the next login attempts, and the screen is shown below:
